# BJT-Signal-Amplifier-Design
I successfully designed and simulated a 3-stage (CC-CE-CC) inverting BJT amplifier using Multisim, earning a near perfect project score by adhering to all design specifications, including a +10 V power supply constraint and a maximum quiescent current of 10 mA. This was achieved by accurately applying AC and DC analysis to the common emitter and common collector circuits, achieving a maximum loaded voltage of 4.084 V and a no-load voltage gain of 50.94. The comprehensive design report, including detailed manual calculations and clear documentation of all key benchmarks and simulations, is available in this repository. Below is the final schematic of the amplifier that was created:
